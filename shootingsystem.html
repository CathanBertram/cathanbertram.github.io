                            <p>This project was a part of my final year of my bachelors degree. It involved designing and producing a game mechanic
                                in Unreal Engine that could be used in a finished a game. I chose to create a shooting system similar to those that
                                can be found in games like counter-strike and valorant. This meant that I needed to have simple hitscan guns that
                                can have repeatable recoil patterns.
                            </p>
                            <p>The guns are very simple. An abstract C++ class was created that held the basic functionality for the gun such as
                                shooting, reloading and fire rate. Shooting was simply done by performing a linetrace and accessing an interface on
                                the object that has been hit, this allowed functions to be performed on the hit object that can allow it to take
                                damage, break or anything else that was required. Reloading was done by resetting the ammo count after finishing a
                                timer, this could have been better by linking it to animations however my primary focus for the project was making
                                recoil patterns easy so I didnâ€™t get around to adding animations. Child classes were created for different types of
                                guns, specifically fully automatic and semi-automatic, to control how they shoot. The base class contained an
                                interface for input to tell the gun when the fire key is pressed and when it is released. For a semi-automatic gun,
                                shooting is very simple as the gun needs to fire when the fire key is pressed provided the gun is not on cooldown.
                                Fully automatic guns are slightly more complex, when the fire key is pressed a bool is toggled to tell the gun that
                                it is currently firing, then in the update function the gun will check if it is currently firing and shoot if it is
                                not on cooldown.
                            </p>
                            <p>Recoil patterns were much more complicated. The basic concept for the recoil pattern was to store a list of Vector3s
                                that would rotate the camera each time the gun is shot. The list entry that was used would be the same as the number
                                of bullets that have been fired before the recoil resets. Implementing this was very simple, the main difficulties
                                come with creating an editor that makes creating recoil patterns much easier. A very simple editor for the recoil
                                patterns was made by using editor modes. An editor mode was created that allowed me to click and add a new point to
                                the recoil pattern. These points could then be edited by clicking and dragging them around. This worked for editing
                                recoil patterns however, additional UI was needed to save and load recoil patterns to ensure that they could be
                                edited after being initially created. This UI was created using Slate which was torture however, it allowed me to
                                create simple UI that could execute functions on the editor to load data from previously made recoil patterns, save
                                new recoil patterns and toggle point visibility in the editor.
                            </p>
                            <p>Overall, this project taught me a lot about using Unreal Engine and how useful custom editors can be. Furthermore it
                                also showed me how useful proper commenting can be in unfamiliar code bases as a lot of documentation for Unreal
                                Engine can be found in the comments of the source code.
